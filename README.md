# How to contribute
- For those of you using eclipse (Assumung this is everyone) I highly suggest
that you git clone this repository and then drag that file into your Eclipse 
workspace
- If you want to add a feature, make a seperate branch, don't alter any of the
  code in master
- Write the code required for that new feature
- Then merge back to master
